# About

SecDB is a open source python project that use blockchain concepts to secure its data, Every block that created or saved is encrypted using SHA 256 and also this project is developed by one dev so if any problem occurred please report it, so the problem will soon be fixed.

# How to use

`python SecDB.py`

# liblary

`OS`

`Shutil`

`Hashlib`

# How it works

So SecDB will save the data in a database and when it save the data it secure the data using SHA 256 so it secure, and it will duplicate the database 10 times and every database is encrypted and you can also use `Check.py` to see if there is a modified database by comparing the file to other.

# Note

Please note that the encrypted data cannot be seen again so it one time see and maybe you ask how can we see the data, you can see the data by writing the data it self on other safe file database and encrypt it with password. **This is not really like a real Blockchain but it use the Blockchain concept to make it secure**

# Original Project (without encryption)

You can download the python file **without encryption** by downloading `SecDB-OR`

# Commands

`delete` to delete all the database
`check` to check and delete all the database (same function)
